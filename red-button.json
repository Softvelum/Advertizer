Let’s assume it’s January, 15th 2018 and it’s 20:15 GMT.
Your server advertising_sync_interval parameter is set to “2” to allow quick changes.

,"comment":{"In this case as soon as you send new response in the nearest sync, Advertizer will start the download of new ad.
In 20:15:05 Advertizer will try to play an ad.
If the ad file is in cache, it will be played.
If the ad is still being downloaded, Advertizer will wait for 10 seconds (which should be enough to download small audio file)
and then all radio listeners will hear this ad."}
